# DataAccess
A Visual C++ dll project to handle various generalized data access needs

The original compiled .dll is 145KB, but it includes several other files that I'm not familiar with what they do. I've included the entire project on the repo, but (to me), the most important ones are the DataAccess/DataAcces.h and DataAccess/DataAccess.cpp files, since that's where the magic happens. I hope someone finds this useful; it was fun to learn new stuff working on it, so feel free to make suggestions for modifications (or modifications for yourself)!
